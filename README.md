### Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm a bioinformatician and PostDoc working in the field of microbial genomics.
Besides hands-on analyses of WGS data, I'm especially interested in the development of bioinformatics methodologies & software tools for the analysis of bacterial WGS data with a special turn towards plasmids.
