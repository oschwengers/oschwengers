### Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm a bioinformatician and PhD candidate working in the field of microbial genomics.
Besides hands-on analyses of microbial WGS data, I'm especially interested in the development of bioinformatics software tools & methods for the analysis of bacterial WGS data with a special turn towards plasmids.
